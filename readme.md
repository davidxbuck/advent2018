## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles, created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at 05:00 (UTC).

## Code
The code is has been written using Python 3.8 (except those which use Matplotlib as it doesn't, to date, support Python 3.8. These will work with Python 3.7) and unit tests where they exist run under pytest.
